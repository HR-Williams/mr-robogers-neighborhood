From 8:15-9:20 I was rereading the assignment and going over past lessons. Mostly looking over TDD lessons which I had less time to work on this week and also looking at my pig-latin/count-by projects to help guide how I will do this project. 
12:45-2: multiple things going on, had to reboot computer. also break to work on linkedin career services assignment which is also due at 5pm
Basically after 2pm I first had computer issues, then I worked on finishing my linkedin career services project. I could have struggled to put in commits before 5 but I'm struggling with the Friday time crunch with commits. I'm really finding it easier to work over the weekend when I dont feel every half hour must show significant changes. This was a hard week as I feel I didn't learn well with my pairs. I will definitely be putting more work into this project this weekend but I understand not much was accomplished on it during the hours it was supposed to get done.
